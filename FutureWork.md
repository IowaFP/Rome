# Future Work
... and also: things that fluff a dissertation.

## Making Rome less shit to write
- Parser in Haskell that spits out Agda derivations? Or...
  - Parse in Agda? (Ick.)
  - Extrinsic, named syntax in Agda that translates (aka, type checks) to Agda derivations.
- Fuck it just implement an interpreter?

## Non-features
- Codata, copatterns, co-induction, et al.
- Record extensibility (or, the dual expression problem).
- 

## Features & (actual) future work
- Remove term fixed point and reintroduce strong normalization.
- Proof reuse and proof extensibility.
