# Changes
- Removed level stratification.
- Removed denotational semantics (to be replaced by operational and/or translation to Ix).
- Remove type-level lambda.
- Restrict kinds to second-order, e.g., κ₁ → κ₂ for
  κ1 = *, κ₂ = κ₁ → κ₂.
- Adding (unverified,i.e., maybe-valued) type checking procedure.
