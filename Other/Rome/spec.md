# Consider
- Term level fixed point
- Normally:
  - mu f → f (mu f)
  - problem: mu f \Branch mu g is good, f (mu f ) \Branch g (\mu g) bad.
- what about needing an application?
  - (\mu f) M → f (\mu f) M
- what about records / co-recursion?
- Do types help? There is a type system story to solve.
- Semantics
  - Recursive Ix (iso recursive types)
    - some form of term level recursion.  Delay???
    - Operational semantics of Ix in Agda
  - Parametric over row theories?
  - Translation from Rome (that is parametric over row theories?)
  - (Have metatheory to prove now.)
    - subject reduction.
    - regularity.
    - Progress & Preservation.
    - Substitution.
