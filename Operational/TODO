- Restore Terms.Theorems.{Soundness,Completeness}
- Index kinds by ℓeveℓ 
- Better denotation of Rωμ
- Writeup on type normalization, for Edinburgh (Aug. 4?) *highest priority*
-- ... and later publication to CPP (Sep 12, 2025)

Today is July 16th. I would like to perform the above in order. But the highest priority is the Edinburgh writeup.

Maybe I give myself until the 23rd to work on Agda before I context switch.
