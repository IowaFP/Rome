	abstract = {Ve introduce basic language constructs and a type discipline as a foundation of structured communication-based concurrent programming. The constructs, which are easily translatable into the summation-less aSynchronous It-calculus,allow prograznmers to organise programs as a combination of multiple flows of (possibly unbounded) reciprocal interactions in a simple and elegant way, subsuming the preceding communication primitives such as method invocation and rendez-vous. The resulting s3mtactic structure is exploited by a type discipline {\textasciitilde}t la ML, which offers a high-level type abstraction of interactive behaviours of programs as well as guaranteeing the compatibility of interaction patterns between processes in a well-typed program. After presenting the formal semantics, the use of language constructs is illustrated through examples, and the basic syntactic results of the type discipline are established. Implementation concerns are also addressed.},

	abstract = {Session types support a type-theoretic formulation of structured patterns of communication, so that the communication behaviour of agents in a distributed system can be veriﬁed by static type checking. Applications include network protocols, business processes, and operating system services. In this paper we deﬁne a multithreaded functional language with session types, which uniﬁes, simpliﬁes and extends previous work. There are four main contributions. First: an operational semantics with buffered channels, instead of the synchronous communication of previous work. Second: we prove that the session type of a channel gives an upper bound on the necessary size of the buffer. Third: session types are manipulated by means of the standard structures of a linear type theory, rather than by means of new forms of typing judgement. Fourth: a notion of subtyping, including the standard subtyping relation for session types (imported into the functional setting), and a novel form of subtyping between standard and linear function types which allows the typechecker to handle linear types conveniently. Our new approach signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes session types in the functional setting, clariﬁes their essential features, and provides a secure foundation for language developments such as polymorphism and object-orientation.},

	abstract = {Session types are formal specifications of communication protocols, allowing protocol implementations to be verified by typechecking. Up to now, session type disciplines have assumed that the communication medium is reliable, with no loss of messages. However, unreliable broadcast communication is common in a wide class of distributed systems such as ad-hoc and wireless sensor networks. Often such systems have structured communication patterns that should be amenable to analysis by means of session types, but the necessary theory has not previously been developed. We introduce the Unreliable Broadcast Session Calculus, a process calculus with unreliable broadcast communication, and equip it with a session type system that we show is sound. We capture two common operations, broadcast and gather, inhabiting dual session types. Message loss may lead to non-synchronised session endpoints. To further account for unreliability we provide with an autonomous recovery mechanism that does not require acknowledgements from session participants. Our type system ensures consistency, safety, and progress between the synchronised endpoints within a session. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our framework by implementing Paxos, the textbook protocol for reaching consensus in an unreliable, asynchronous network.},

We explore the limits of this method in the setting of finitelystratified System F using the Agda proof assistant. This system supports elegant definitions of denotational semantics as well as big-step operational semantics based on intrinsically typed syntax. While its syntactic metatheory (i.e., type consistency) works well, we demonstrate that its semantic metatheory poses technical challenges, by defining a logical relation and proving its fundamental lemma. Our logical relation connects a denotational semantics with an operational one, which exposes issues with transfer lemmas as well as minor issues with universe polymorphism.},

The approach uses neither dependent types nor termination proofs. Instead, a particular interface dubbed a recursion universe is provided by Cedille, and the language ensures that all programs written against this interface terminate. Standard polymorphic typing is all that is needed to check the code against the interface. This answers a challenge posed by Bove, Krauss, and Sozeau.},
