# TODO 
Make a new lagda document with:
  - Cleaned up / consolidated .stys & infrastructure
  - section skeleton
  - Figures (syntax of types, syntax of normal types, etc.)
  - Add all the new, working Agda code (replace drivel with `bot`)
  - Then fill in the writing around it.

  In short, first focus on the presentation of the development and worry about writing after. Also try citing Abel for definition of normaliation vs. evaluation and correctness properties.

Also, fuck with Emacs to bind correct agda compilation to C-c C-a when in .lagda.tex and .lagda files.
